<h4>Material Coverage</h4>
The final will test material covered since the beginning of the semester though cover more intensively material after the midterm. This includes
-- everything we have done in class (readings, lectures, labs,
homework) except what was covered in discussion.

<h4>Administration</h4>
The final will be administered in <em>two parts</em>.
<br/><br/>
The first part will be administered in lab.
Please be on time and attend the lab your are signed up for.
This part of the final will be done on the computer: you will each sit one computer
per student, and we will ask you to download files and instructions off of a certain location.
You will submit your final answers on <a href="https://bcourses.berkeley.edu"
style="text-decoration: none;">bCourses</a> under the assignments tab and under the "Online Final" assignment corresponding to your lab.

<br/><br/>
The second part will be administered at the time and place listed on the course calendar.
It will be done on paper, and we will provide a list of the blocks available in Scratch and BYOB
that you can use.  The style of this part of the final will be similar to that of the midterm:
we will ask you questions on the readings, on various concepts, and on programming in BYOB.
You are allowed <strong>three study sheets</strong> of size 8.5" x 11", handwritten on both
sides.

<br/><br/>

Please let the staff know if you have a legitimate conflict with the times of the midterm
administrations so that we can make alternate arrangements.  Please let us know the deadline listed on the corresponding Piazza post; we cannot help you if you inform us the day before the final exam.

<a href="https://xkcd.com/894/" style="text-decoration: none;"><b>read this
comic strip</b></a>.  Work through the labs and homework once again, and ask questions if anything
is unclear.  We have also posted previous Finals below. You may find them useful to get a sense
