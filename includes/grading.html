<h2>Grade Breakdown</h2>
<p>For the most part, we would prefer to teach this course <i>without</i>
    grades. What a wonderful concept, learning for learning sake! However,
    even though we can't change the "system" overnight, we can create grading
    policies that support learning as much as possible. The various course
    activities will contribute to your grade as follows:

<h2>How We'll Calculate Your Grade</h2>
<p>Your letter grade will be determined by total course points, as shown in
  the table below. Incomplete grades will be granted only for dire medical
  or personal emergencies that cause you to miss the final exam, and only if
  your work up to that point is satisfactory.</p>
