          <p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CS10</b>: <i>The Beauty and Joy of
              Computing</i>, is an exciting new course offered by the <a href="https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/">
              UC Berkeley EECS Department</a>. Computing has changed the world in profound
            ways. It has opened up wonderful new ways for people to connect, design,
            research, play, create, and express themselves. However, just using a
            computer is only a small part of the picture. The real transformative and
            empowering experience comes when one learns how to program the computer,
            to translate ideas into code. This course will teach students how to do
            exactly that, using <a
              href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/run"><em>Snap!</em></a> (based on <a href="https://www.scratch.mit.edu">
              Scratch</a>), one of the friendliest programming languages ever
            invented. It's purely graphical, which means programming involves simply
            dragging blocks around, and building bigger blocks out of smaller blocks.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;"> But this course is far more than just
            learning to program. We'll focus on some of the "Big Ideas" of computing,
            such as abstraction, design, recursion, concurrency, simulations, and the
            limits of computation. We'll show some beautiful applications of computing
            that have changed the world, talk about the history of computing, and
            where it will go in the future. Throughout the course, relevance will be
            emphasized: relevance to the student and to society. As an example, the
            final project will be completely of the students' choosing, on a topic
            most interesting to them. The overarching theme is to expose students to
            the beauty and joy of computing. This course is designed for computing
            non-majors, although interested majors are certainly welcome to take the
            class as well! We are especially excited about bringing computing (through
            this course) to traditionally under-represented groups in computing, i.e.,
            women and ethnic minorities. </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify"> Some context: in the Fall of 2009, we
            piloted a 2-unit version of this course as the freshman/sophomore seminar
            <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs10/fa09/">CS39N: The Beauty
              and Joy of Computing</a> to 20 students. <a href="https://innovations.coe.berkeley.edu/vol3-issue10-dec09/beauty-and-joy-of-computing">It
              was such a success</a> that we decided to move ahead to make this course
            our new computing course for non-majors, replacing the venerable <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Ecs3l/">
              CS3L</a> and <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Eselfpace/class/cs3s">
              CS3S</a> . Since then, this has been one of the most popular courses in
            EECS. Don't believe us? <a href="https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/coursesurveys/course/CS/10">See
              for yourself!</a> We're continuing to grow the course as word spreads to
            more students. We're continually replacing the weakest parts of the
            curriculum and hope you'll enjoy! </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify"> We will be using Pair Programming,
            described best by Laurie Williams, a computer science professor at North
            Carolina State University: "Two programmers working side-by-side,
            collaborating on the same design, algorithm, code or test. One programmer,
            the driver, has control of the keyboard/mouse and actively implements the
            program. The other programmer, the observer, continuously observes the
            work of the driver to identify tactical (syntactic, spelling, etc.)
            defects and also thinks strategically about the direction of the work. On
            demand, the two programmers can brainstorm any challenging problem.
            Because the two programmers periodically switch roles, they work together
            as equals to develop software." </p>
